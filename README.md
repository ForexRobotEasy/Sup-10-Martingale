## Code Explanation
The code provided here is written in MQL5 and consists of several functions and constants. Below, we explain the purpose and functionality of each section of the code:

### Include necessary libraries
This section includes the necessary library `InrexEA.mqh` for the InrexEA DB system.

### Define constants
This section defines the following constants:
- `SYMBOL`: Specifies the trading symbol as 'XAUUSD'.
- `LOT_SIZE`: Specifies the lot size for each trade as 0.01.
- `MAX_ORDERS`: Specifies the maximum number of orders allowed as 10.
- `MARTINGALE_FACTOR`: Specifies the martingale factor as 2.

### Initialize InrexEA DB system
This section initializes the InrexEA DB system by creating an instance of the `InrexEA` class.

### Expert initialization function
The `OnInit()` function is the expert initialization function. It is called once when the expert advisor is first initialized. In this function, the InrexEA DB system is initialized by calling the `Init()` function, which takes the trading symbol and timeframe as parameters.

### Expert deinitialization function
The `OnDeinit()` function is the expert deinitialization function. It is called once when the expert advisor is being shut down. In this function, the InrexEA DB system is deinitialized by calling the `Deinit()` function.

### Expert tick function
The `OnTick()` function is the expert tick function. It is called on each tick of the market. In this function, the following steps are performed:
1. Calculate the lot size based on the martingale factor and the total number of orders using the `TotalOrders()` function of the InrexEA DB system.
2. Check if the maximum number of orders has been reached using the `TotalOrders()` function.
3. Check if the market trend is in favor using the `IsTrendUp()` and `IsTrendDown()` functions.
4. Open a buy or sell order using the `OpenOrder()` function of the InrexEA DB system.
5. Close losing orders based on the martingale factor using the `CloseLosingOrders()` function of the InrexEA DB system.

### Check if market trend is up
The `IsTrendUp()` function is responsible for checking if the market trend is up for the specified symbol. The implementation of this function is not provided in the code and should be implemented separately.

### Check if market trend is down
The `IsTrendDown()` function is responsible for checking if the market trend is down for the specified symbol. The implementation of this function is not provided in the code and should be implemented separately.

### Open a new order
The `OpenOrder()` function is responsible for opening a new order with the specified parameters. The implementation of this function is not provided in the code and should be implemented separately.

### Close losing orders
The `CloseLosingOrders()` function is responsible for closing losing orders based on the martingale factor. The implementation of this function is not provided in the code and should be implemented separately.
